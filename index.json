The key idea of SneakySnake is to provide fast and highly accurate filtering by reducing the ASM problem to the single net routing (SNR) problem in VLSI chip layout. In the SNR problem, we are interested in only finding the path that connects two terminals with the least routing cost on a special grid layout that contains obstacles. The SneakySnake algorithm quickly and optimally solves the SNR problem and uses the found optimal path to decide whether performing sequence alignment is necessary. We also build two new hardware accelerator designs, Snake-on-Chip and Snake-on-GPU, that adopts modern FPGA and GPU architectures, respectively, to further boost the performance of our algorithm. SneakySnake significantly improves the accuracy of pre-alignment filtering by up to four orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art pre-alignment filters, Shouji, GateKeeper, and SHD. SneakySnake accelerates the state-of-the-art CPU-based sequence aligners, Edlib and Parasail, by up to 37.6x and 43.9x, respectively, without requiring hardware acceleration. The addition of Snake-on-Chip and Snake-on-GPU as a pre-alignment filter reduces the execution time of four state-of-the-art sequence aligners, designed for different computing platforms, by up to 689x (101x on average). To our knowledge, SneakySnake is the only pre-alignment filtering mechanism that works on all modern high-performance computing architectures. Unlike most existing works that aim to accelerate sequence alignment, SneakySnake does not sacrifice any of the aligner capabilities (i.e., scoring and backtracking), as it does not modify or replace the aligner.

Many existing methods based on marker genes or k-mers have limited sensitivity or are too computationally demanding for many users. Additionally, most work in metagenomics has focused on bacteria and archaea, neglecting to study other key microbes such as viruses and eukaryotes. Results Here we present a method, MiCoP (Microbiome Community Profiling), that uses fast-mapping of reads to build a comprehensive reference database of full genomes from viruses and eukaryotes to achieve maximum read usage and enable the analysis of the virome and eukaryome in each sample. We demonstrate that mapping of metagenomic reads is feasible for the smaller viral and eukaryotic reference databases. We show that our method is accurate on simulated and mock community data and identifies many more viral and fungal species than previously-reported results on real data from the Human Microbiome Project. Conclusions MiCoP is a mapping-based method that proves more effective than existing methods at abundance profiling of viruses and eukaryotes in metagenomic samples.

Over the past decade, high throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies have opened the door to remarkable biomedical discoveries through its ability to generate hundreds of millions to billions of DNA segments per run along with a substantial reduction in time and cost. However, this flood of sequencing data continues to overwhelm the processing capacity of existing algorithms and hardware. To analyze a patient’s genome, each of these segments -called reads- must be mapped to a reference genome based on the similarity between a read and “candidate” locations in that reference genome. The similarity measurement, called alignment, formulated as an approximate string matching problem, is the computational bottleneck because: (1) it is implemented using quadratic-time dynamic programming algorithms, and (2) the majority of candidate locations in the reference genome do not align with a given read due to high dissimilarity. Calculating the alignment of such incorrect candidate locations consumes an overwhelming majority of a modern read mapper’s execution time. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a fast and effective filter that can detect incorrect candidate locations and eliminate them before invoking computationally costly alignment algorithms.  In this thesis, we introduce four new algorithms that function as a prealignment step and aim to filter out most incorrect candidate locations. We call our algorithms GateKeeper, Shouji, MAGNET, and SneakySnake. The first key idea of our proposed pre-alignment filters is to provide high filtering accuracy by correctly detecting all similar segments shared between two sequences. The second key idea is to exploit the massively parallel architecture of modern FPGAs for accelerating our four proposed filtering algorithms. We also develop an efficient CPU implementation of the SneakySnake algorithm for commodity desktops and servers, which are largely available to bioinformaticians without the hassle of handling hardware complexity. We evaluate the benefits and downsides of our pre-alignment filtering approach in detail using 12 real datasets across different read length and edit distance thresholds. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our hardware pre-alignment filters show two to three orders of magnitude speedup over their equivalent CPU implementations. We also demonstrate that integrating our hardware pre-alignment filters with the state-of-the-art read aligners reduces the aligner’s execution time by up to 21.5x. Finally, we show that efficient CPU implementation of pre-alignment filtering still provides significant benefits. We show that SneakySnake on average reduces the execution time of the best performing CPU-based read aligners Edlib and Parasail, by up to 43x and 57.9x, respectively. The key conclusion of this thesis is that developing a fast and efficient filtering heuristic, and developing a better understanding of its accuracy together leads to significant reduction in read alignment’s execution time, without sacrificing any of the aligner’ capabilities. We hope and believe that our new architectures and algorithms catalyze their adoption in existing and future genome analysis pipelines.","tags":null,"title":"Accelerating the Understanding of Life's Code Through Better Algorithms and Hardware Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeremie Kim","Damla Senol","Hongyi Xin","Donghyuk Lee","Mohammed Alser","Hasan Hassan","Oguz Ergin","Can Alkan","Onur Mutlu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525824000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525824000,"objectID":"a55d98857245e78b784bf1c60749f1c6","permalink":"/publication/kim-2017-grimfilter/","publishdate":"2020-01-11T14:37:22.022632Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kim-2017-grimfilter/","section":"publication","summary":" Background Seed location filtering is critical in DNA read mapping, a process where billions of DNA fragments (reads) sampled from a donor are mapped onto a reference genome to identify genomic variants of the donor. State-of-the-art read mappers 1) quickly generate possible mapping locations for seeds (i.e., smaller segments) within each read, 2) extract reference sequences at each of the mapping locations, and 3) check similarity between each read and its associated reference sequences with a computationally-expensive algorithm (i.e., sequence alignment) to determine the origin of the read. A seed location filter comes into play before alignment, discarding seed locations that alignment would deem a poor match. The ideal seed location filter would discard all poor match locations prior to alignment such that there is no wasted computation on unnecessary alignments. Results We propose a novel seed location filtering algorithm, GRIM-Filter, optimized to exploit 3D-stacked memory systems that integrate computation within a logic layer stacked under memory layers, to perform processing-in-memory (PIM). GRIM-Filter quickly filters seed locations by 1) introducing a new representation of coarse-grained segments of the reference genome, and 2) using massively-parallel in-memory operations to identify read presence within each coarse-grained segment. Our evaluations show that for a sequence alignment error tolerance of 0.05, GRIM-Filter 1) reduces the false negative rate of filtering by 5.59x–6.41x, and 2) provides an end-to-end read mapper speedup of 1.81x–3.65x, compared to a state-of-the-art read mapper employing the best previous seed location filtering algorithm. Conclusion GRIM-Filter exploits 3D-stacked memory, which enables the efficient use of processing-in-memory, to overcome the memory bandwidth bottleneck in seed location filtering. We show that GRIM-Filter significantly improves the performance of a state-of-the-art read mapper. GRIM-Filter is a universal seed location filter that can be applied to any read mapper.
